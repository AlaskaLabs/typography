### 1. Choosing a font for your project
**Typography is the foundation of any design project.**

Typography dictates a lot of how people will feel when they experience your designs. Choosing the right fonts for your project is one of the most important steps in the beginning. 

#### Principles for choosing typography:
1. **Familiarity.** People recognize things more easily when they're familiar. Not only that, familiarity inherits trust.
	- **Align the look with your brand.** If you keep using different fonts for different projects in the same brand, how will the customers recognize or even trust that the project is from that brand?
	- **Look for competitors or similar projects to see what they're already using.** You don't have to copy them. But you shouldn't steer away from the familiarity _unless you have a good reason to do so._
2. **Aesthetic-Usability.** People perceive aesthetically pleasing designs as more usable. [`ref`](https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect/)
	- **Use well-designed fonts.** A well-designed font looks great with all combination of characters, and has all characters you need. Eg: if the spacing between letters feels off, it's a red flag.
	- **Prioritize readability.** Choose fonts that work great on very small sizes and very large sizes, according to your needs. At the end of the day, you want to convey a message, and if your audience can't read it, you failed.
3. **Doherty Threshold.** People don't want to wait. [`ref`](https://lawsofux.com/doherty-threshold/)
	- **Optimize for performance.** A lot of fonts are heavy, and take a long time to load. You can remedy that by adding a loading screen in your project until the font finishes loading.
4. **Experience-first.** What do you want your audience/customer to experience? Think about it for a second. Do you want them to feel luxurious? Do you want them to feel in the future, in the past, or the present?
	- **Look for references that make you feel how you want your audience to feel.** You can look for it in competitors websites, or similar industries. You can also look for it in movie posters, advertisements, and several other mediums.


#### What do you want people to feel?

| Category | Psychology Associations | Description |
| :--- | :----- | :--------- |
| Serif | Formal, traditional, intellectual. | These fonts are used in industries that require a more traditional and trustworthy look, like law firms, newspapers. They are also used in industries that require a sophisticated look, like luxury fashion brands. |
| Slab Serif | Powerful, strong, industrial | Most used in industries that are more industrial, like manufacturers. Some of these fonts remind a lot of the "old-west" look from the US. |
| Sans-serif | Informal, friendly, modern, approachable. | Nowadays, sans-serif fonts are the most used because of their great readability. When it comes to brands, and industries, it's most used in tech companies, social media sites, retail brands. |
| Modern Sans-serif | Progressive, modern, sophisticated. | These fonts are largely adopted by sophisticated modern industries, like luxury brands, edgy startups, architecture. |
| Script | Fun, elegant, romantic. | Script fonts have been used by big brands like Disney, Ray-Ban, and Coca-Cola because of their look. They can look great in big text, but not legible for small text. |
| Display | Independent fonts. | Display fonts are mostly used for titles, and big text. They can range from most categories, and even look weird (like gooey or like geometric shapes). |

### 2. Line-height & Tracking `letter-spacing`

By default, some fonts are more spaced between the letters, or have a closer space between lines. The way they're build directly affects the aesthetic, and readability of your design.

Sometimes, they look great by default. Other times, you have to adjust them.

There are some principles you can apply for creating visually appealing designs, and improving readability by adjusting your fonts.

> I play around with `line-height` and `letter-spacing` for each element style. 
>
> As a rule-of-thumb, the bigger the text, the closer the spacing should be. As the text gets smaller, the space between letters, and lines should increase.

#### Rule-of-Thumb

| - | Size | Line-height | Letter-spacing | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Paragraph/Text | `14px` - `18px` | `120%` - `180%` | `-2%` - `+1%` |
| Heading/Title | `28px` - `+250px` | `75%` - `120%` | `-5%` - `0%` |

You can use this formula to make your fonts look better, BUT... You should always refer to optical vs. math. 

Your eyes perceive size, alignment, and space according to the surrounding elements. It's weird, but exact maths does not help. To understand more about this, read [Best Practices for Measured vs. Optical Alignment](https://liferay.design/articles/best-practices/measured-vs-optical-alignment/).
