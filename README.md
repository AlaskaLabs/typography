### 1. Choosing a font for your project
**Typography is the foundation of any design project.**

Typography dictates a lot of how people will feel when they experience your designs. Choosing the right fonts for your project is one of the most important steps in the beginning. 

#### Principles for choosing typography:
1. **Familiarity.** People recognize things more easily when they're familiar. Not only that, familiarity inherits trust.
	- **Align the look with your brand.** If you keep using different fonts for different projects in the same brand, how will the customers recognize or even trust that the project is from that brand?
	- **Look for competitors or similar projects to see what they're already using.** You don't have to copy them. But you shouldn't steer away from the familiarity _unless you have a good reason to do so._
2. **Aesthetic-Usability.** People perceive aesthetically pleasing designs as more usable. [`ref`](https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect/)
	- **Use well-designed fonts.** A well-designed font looks great with all combination of characters, and has all characters you need. Eg: if the spacing between letters feels off, it's a red flag.
	- **Prioritize readability.** Choose fonts that work great on very small sizes and very large sizes, according to your needs. At the end of the day, you want to convey a message, and if your audience can't read it, you failed.
3. **Doherty Threshold.** People don't want to wait. [`ref`](https://lawsofux.com/doherty-threshold/)
	- **Optimize for performance.** A lot of fonts are heavy, and take a long time to load. You can remedy that by adding a loading screen in your project until the font finishes loading.
4. **Experience-first.** What do you want your audience/customer to experience? Think about it for a second. Do you want them to feel luxurious? Do you want them to feel in the future, in the past, or the present?
	- **Look for references that make you feel how you want your audience to feel.** You can look for it in competitors websites, or similar industries. You can also look for it in movie posters, advertisements, and several other mediums.


#### What do you want people to feel?

| Category | Psychology Associations | Description |
| :--- | :----- | :--------- |
| Serif | Formal, traditional, intellectual. | These fonts are used in industries that require a more traditional and trustworthy look, like law firms, newspapers. They are also used in industries that require a sophisticated look, like luxury fashion brands. |
| Slab Serif | Powerful, strong, industrial | Most used in industries that are more industrial, like manufacturers. Some of these fonts remind a lot of the "old-west" look from the US. |
| Sans-serif | Informal, friendly, modern, approachable. | Nowadays, sans-serif fonts are the most used because of their great readability. When it comes to brands, and industries, it's most used in tech companies, social media sites, retail brands. |
| Modern Sans-serif | Progressive, modern, sophisticated. | These fonts are largely adopted by sophisticated modern industries, like luxury brands, edgy startups, architecture. |
| Script | Fun, elegant, romantic. | Script fonts have been used by big brands like Disney, Ray-Ban, and Coca-Cola because of their look. They can look great in big text, but not legible for small text. |
| Display | Independent fonts. | Display fonts are mostly used for titles, and big text. They can range from most categories, and even look weird (like gooey or like geometric shapes). |
